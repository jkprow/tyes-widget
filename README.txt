Upload the files in the tyes-animation directory to your hosting provider.
Then, add:
  <div id="animation-main"></div>
to the body of your HTML document and:
  <script type="module" src="/tyes-animation/index.js"></script>
before the end of the body tag.
Adjust the path of the src attribute as needed depending on your configuration.
